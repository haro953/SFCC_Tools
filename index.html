          <h2>File Scanner Tool</h2>
          <div class="toolLink">
              The File scanner tool allows you to upload a file type of your choice and search that file for general or exact matches
              of text and characters. If found the tool will let you know how many matches were found and highlight those matches in red.</br></br>
              This tool is specifically designed for scanning large files and confirming if your code or term is present without having to 
              open the file in an editor and scroll through it.

        <a href="fileDiffer.html" class="toolLink">
          <h2>File Diff Tool</h2>
          <div class="toolLink">
              The file diff tool allows you to quickly upload two files of your choosing and compare those files for differences.</br></br>
              In the future this tool will also have a deep scan option that will compare the files line by line and let you know 
              if a match is not found anywhere in the other file regardless of its position.
          </div>
        </a>
        <a href="fileImport.html" class="toolLink">
          <h2>File Import Tool</h2>
          <div class="toolLink">
              The file import tool allows you to upload two xml files the first file being the file that has newly created metadata 
              and the second file being the file that should receieve that new metadata.</br></br> 
              Once uploaded the files display for review
              and are then able to be merged into a single file containing the metadata from both files. The newly merged file is then
              displayed and can be copied or downloaded with a timestamp for your convenience.</br></br> This tool sloves the age old problem of 
              syncing data as you work on new features for releases without having to worry about losing work or manually copying and pasting metadata between files.
